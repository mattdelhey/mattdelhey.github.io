title: 'Work In Progress: Rice Course Enrollment'

Here's a side project. I've always wanted to know more about course
enrollment here at Rice U. What are the best classes? What is the
distribution of undergraduate enrollment across departments?

These are basic questions with known answers which remain entirely
hidden to students. I suppose transparency isn't encompassed in
unconventional wisdom. Regardless, Rice has a nice public API at
[courses.rice.edu](http://courses.rice.edu) which holds the answer to
my later question, among others. I should mention that I've currently
only got a hold of Fall 2014 data, so adjust accordingly.

So, let's answer using the new
[ggvis](https://github.com/rstudio/ggvis). What departments are the
most popular?

Psychology, Biochemistry, and Economics. Not too surprising. Seeing MATH
and such near the top doesn't tell us as much about the popularity of
mathematics as it does about the prevalence of their required
low-level courses.

Bonus question: what about undergraduate class sizes?

Business is the worst offender. No real surprises, except for perhaps
for English being below Philosophy.

This is still a WIP. I intend to eventually answer my first
question. Track my progress on
