<p>Not as much to say about this one. A collection of folk covers, instrumentals, and acoustic songs. I suppose you either get it or you move on. It&#39;s eerie to see eye to eye with an album in this way, but I guess that&#39;s why we play the music game in the first place.</p>

<p>Favorite tracks: Take My Word / Lilli Schull</p>

	    <div class="post-content"><p><img src="/images/albums/sleeper.jpg" alt="ty segall - sleeper"></p>

<p>Yet another Ty Segall album. But this one&#39;s a bit different, composed mostly of acoustic guitars and Ty&#39;s vocals (sorry fuzz lovers). Overall it&#39;s pretty good. This is a slightly more mature TS and it&#39;s nice to see him make a song that sounds at least somewhat different than all of his other songs. Tracks &quot;Sleeper&quot; and &quot;The Keepers&quot; are catchy as hell, &quot;Sweet C.C.&quot; is just great, and &quot;The West&quot; sounds like a Ty Segall take on Woody Guthrie to an enjoyable result. </p>

	    <div class="post-content"><p><img src="/images/albums/mc5.png" alt="mc5"></p>

<p>A debut live album has never been so appropriate. The Motor City 5 make themselves entirely clear: you’re either with them, or against them. And from the instant Rob Tyner ends his call to arms to the audience, you’re bombarded with some of my favorite Rock N’ Roll this side of the Atlantic. Taking The Stooges to their populist extension, MC5 show the world what an electric guitar and a no-fucks-given attitude can entail, 7 years before 1976. Kick out the jams motherfuckers.</p>

	    <div class="post-content"><p><img src="/images/albums/fugazi.jpg" alt="fugazi"></p>

<p>You probably don’t listen to much ‘post-hardcore’—at least I don’t. But Fugazi rock’s, man. This debut EP is a killer, delivering ridiculously memorable punk riffs on nearly every track. Vocal style is somewhere between Paul Westerberg and Blink 182, which actually works in practice. Fugazi tows the perfect line between indie rock and punk in this release, each song seemingly more like a perfect Pixies b-side than the last (or maybe the Pixies wished they sounded like Fugazi??). “Badmouth” is as good as anything hitting the alternative airwaves at the time and “Give Me The Cure” seems to have perfected Spiderland three years before it’s own release...</p>

	    <div class="post-content"><p><img src="/images/albums/mlv.jpg" alt="mlv"></p>

<p>Punk for lovers, if you want to put it that way. Or just a continuation of VU (produced by J. Cale nonetheless). For all their pop intentions The Modern Lovers never received due attention and are continuously looked over by otherwise well-listened hipsters of our day. This is the band’s one &amp; only LP and points to the direction punk could have gone. Richman’s vocal delivery style is laid back and heartfelt (cmon, he just want’s a girl he cares about...) which is supported with distorted guitars that I swear are sampled from White Light/White Heat. Classic tracks include Roadrunner / Pablo Picasso / Girlfriend / I’m Straight. Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole...</p>

	    <div class="post-content"><p><img src="/images/albums/cramps.jpg" alt="the cramps"></p>

<p>With all the hype surrounding garage rock nowadays you’d think you’d hear more about The Cramps (edit: maybe you do). This five track debut EP is a great introduction, highlighting the band’s strange lyrical style and aggressiveness. Alex Chilton (of Big Star fame) does wonders with the production, giving the guitars their bright, rockabilly sound. Those new to The Cramps will enjoy the single-worthy tracks “Human Fly” and “The Way I Walk” and fans can still grab this release for the bombastic “Surfin’ Bird” cover (proto-proto punk??)</p>
