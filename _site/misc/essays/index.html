	<h3>Fall 2013</h3>

<p>The following are a collection of essay&#39;s I&#39;ve written in my undergraduate philosophy courses. I don&#39;t think any of them are worth bragging about. I&#39;ve tried to include a summary of what I attempt to do in each paper.</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, I find essays that address the most interesting philosophical questions in turn travel down and dwell within the most challenging pathways for my thinking. To write analytically is much easier and so that is the form of my papers. I don&#39;t dare dwell on a philosophical questioning of actual importance because I do not have the weaponry to make any forward ground under the fire of critical examination of my reasoning (nor would it be the appropriate place even if I did). </p>

        <blockquote style="font-style:normal">
        Spinoza's Proposition 13 asserts that the object of the idea constituting the human mind is indeed nothing but an existing body. In this paper I first observe that Spinoza's argument for Pr.13 is two-fold, each in the form of proof by contradiction. I offer a basic (i.e. naive) reconstruction of the argument and raise two objections, which I find fatal to the demonstration as reconstructed. Finally, I offer a second reconstruction that (1) mediates my objections by means of (2) better capturing Spinoza's implicit assumptions in the demonstration.

        <a href="/essays/Spinoza-imm-soul.pdf">On Spinoza's Doctorine of the Eternal Mind</a>
        <blockquote style="font-style:normal">
        In Propositions 22-23 of Ethics V, Spinoza turns his discussion to the eternality of the essence of body and the human mind. The full statement of the doctrine is Proposition 23: the human mind cannot be absolutely destroyed along with the body, but something of it remains and is eternal. This doctrine has important implications for Spinoza’s moral philosophy as well as his metaphysics and has thus been the focus of much scholarly attention. In this paper, I first put Spinoza’s argument on the table with a basic reconstruction. I then consider both Curley’s and Bennett’s interpretation of the argument and its relevant premises. I agree with Bennett in his objection to what he calls Curley’s symmetrical account, but aim to avoid Bennett’s conclusion that Spinoza’s argument is altogether wrong by exploring the possibility of a new interpretation of the relevant premises.
