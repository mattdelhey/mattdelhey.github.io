      <a href="/science/2013/08/11/hidden-markov-models.html">Simulating Hidden Markov Models using R</a>
    </h1>
    <p>Ever wanted to explore Hidden Markov Models? It's extraordinarily easy using some of R's packages. Here I'm going to run through a quick example of modeling HMM's with the Viterbi algorithm and Posterior probabilities on a simulation using the __HMM__ package, with a focus on computation and visualization rather than mathematics (that's all on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) anyways!)</p>

      <a href="/science/2013/02/01/reconstructing-minards-march.html">Reconstructing Napoleon's Failed March to Russia</a>
    </h1>
    <p>Above is perhaps one the most famous statistical graphics ever created, found in nearly every history text-book (at least the ones I read...) that discusses Napoleon's failed invasions of Russia in 1812. The graphic was originally created by [Charles Joseph Minard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard), a statistician ahead of his time.</p>

      <a href="/science/2013/01/13/ufo.html">A Quick Look At UFO Reports Across the U.S.</a>
    </h1>
    <p>Here's quick bit of data visualization that utilizes ggplot's fast and easy map-building abilities.  Using the rather large [National UFO Reporting Center Online Database](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports.html) available on [Infochimp's](http://www.infochimps.com) dataset search engine, we can create a simple map of the continental United States and get a feel for the distribution of UFO reports by state between the years 2000 to 2010.</p>

      <a href="/science/2013/01/10/kaggle-excel-in-r.html">Kaggle: Getting Started with Excel -- In R</a>
    </h1>
    <p>If you're reading this blog post then you might have used Kaggle, a flashy resource in the data science world that works both as a platform for competition and for knowledge. The focus of the site is machine learning, something that is rather new to me. Being the awesome people that they are, Kaggle has put together a short series of guides for getting started, the [first of which](http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/details/getting-started-with-excel) involves using Excel. But Excel is kinda boring, so I thought it would be fun to run through the guide using R and ggplot2 visualizations.</p>

      <a href="/science/2013/01/01/basic-fern.html">Basic Python: Creating a Fern</a>
    </h1>
    <p>In this short post I'm going to demonstrate how to use __Scipy__ and __matplotlib__ to make a basic graph of a fern. This is inspired from an introductory computational mathematics course that I'm currently taking in which we did the same task using __MATLAB__. Personally, I find __MATLAB__ to be less satisfying than __Python__, so I thought it pleasant to make a quick translation.</p>

    </h1>
    <p>Here's an example of extracting interesting information from a real data set generated from our on-campus Recreation Center here at Rice University. The data set given to me contains information regarding all swipes into the Rec center in September, 2011, including time (rounded to the nearest fifteen minutes), sex, and status (e.g. graduate student, alumni, etc.)</p>
