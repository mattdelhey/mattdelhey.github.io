  <p>Lacan has of reputation of being difficult to read without context
into his thinking, so Zizek&#39;s &#39;How to Read Lacan&#39; seemed like an
appropriate place to being a conversation. Not quite true. The book
would be better titled, as one reviews states, &#39;How to Read Zizek using
Lacan&#39;. Psychoanalysis, nonetheless, is at the forefront.</p>

<p>This passage, taken from pg. 29-31, is a particularly interesting
application of PA theory. In it, cultural beliefs are unpacked in
terms of their functioning at a distance, i.e. with a fictional
subject.</p>

<blockquote>
What many readers of Lacan fail to notice is how the figure of the
subject supposed to know [the analyst] is a secondary phenomenon, an
exception, something that emerges against the more fundamental
background of the <i>subject supposed to believe</i> [the analysand], which
is the constitutive feature of the symbolic order. According to a
well-known anthropological anecdote, the primitives to whom certain
superstitious beliefs were attributed (that they descended from a
fish or from a bird, for example), when directly asked about these
beliefs, answered: "Of course not --- I'm not that stupid. But I have
been told that some of our ancestors actually did believe that..." In
short, they transferred their belief onto another. Are we not doing
the same with our children? We go through the ritual of Santa Claus,
since our children (are supposed to) believe in it and we do not want
to disappoint them; they pretend to believe so as not to disappoint us
and our belief in their naivety (and to get presents, of course). Is
not this need to find another who 'really believes' also that which
propels us in our need to stigmatize the other as a religious or
ethnic fundamentalist? In an uncanny way some beliefs always seem to
function at a distance: in order for the belief to function, there has
to be some ultimate guarantor of it, some true believer, yet this
guarantor is always deferred, displaced, never present in person. How,
then, is belief possible? How is this vicious cycle of deferred belief
cut short? The point, of course, is that, for the belief to be
operative, the subject who directly believes need not exist at all: it
is enough precisely to presuppose his existence, to believe in it,
either in the guise of the mythological founding figure who is not
part of our reality, or in the guise of the impersonal actor, the
unspecified agent --- "They say that ..." / "It is said that..."
</blockquote>

The most interesting point, I think, is the one about
fundamentalism. Here, SZ explains that the fundamentalist acts in
opposition to the postmodern ethic: they actually stand for something!
Or, in other words, they dare to <i>actually</i> believe that which is now
understood as socially constructed. What a sham. </p>

<blockquote> This, at least, seems to be the predominant status of
beliefs today, in our era that claims for itself the title
'post-ideological'. Niels Bohr, who had aptly replied to Einstein's
'God doesn't place dice' ("Don't tell God what to do!"), also provided
the perfect example of how a fetishist disavowal of belief works in
ideology. Seeing a horseshoe on Bohr's door, a surprised visitor
remarked that he didn't believe in the superstition that it brought
luck. Bohr snapped back: "I Don't believe in it either; I have it
there because I was told that it also works if one does not believe in
it!" Perhaps this is why 'culture' is emerging as the central
life-world category. With regard to religion, we no longer 'really
believe', we just follow (various) religious rituals and behaviors as
part of a respect for the 'life-style' of the community we belong to
(non-believing Jews may obey kosher rules "out of respect for
tradition"). "I do not really believe in it, it is just part of my
culture" seems to be the predominant mode of the displaced belief,
characteristic of our times. <i>'Culture' is the name for all those
things we practice without really believing in them</i>, without taking
them quite seriously. This is why we dismiss fundamentalist believers
as 'barbarians', as anti-cultural, as a threat to culture --- they
dare to take their beliefs seriously.

<p>Here, the emphasis is mine. Alright, so our mantra is &#39;no beliefs&#39;
(or, equivalently, &#39;only beliefs&#39;, e.g. multiculturalism). Zizek allows
that this could just be an act of well-adjusted laziness, a
reversal of the Tibetan prayer wheel. The prayer wheel removes the act
of belief from the actual believer and thus relives us from our
praying duties. Postmodern belief removes the actual believer but
keeps in tact the act of belief and thus relives us of the much
greater burden of actually believing:</p>

<blockquote>
Today... we turn Pascal's logic around: "You believe too
much, too directly? You find your belief too oppressing in its raw
immediacy? Then kneel down, act as if you believe, and you will get
rid of your belief --- you will no longer have to believe yourself,
since your belief will be objectified in your act of praying!" ... to
believe is an oppressive burden which, happily, can be offloaded onto
another by the practice of a ritual.
</blockquote>

<p><br />
We can also interpret this in Kierkegaardian terms: postmodern belief
locks us in the lowest form of despair of not being conscious of
having a self, that man is spirit. Not too bad: it is undeniable that
lacking such consciousness is the most surefire way to improve across
important happiness and well-being metrics.</p>
